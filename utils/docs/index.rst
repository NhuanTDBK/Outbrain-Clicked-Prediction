MDEntropy
=========

MDEntropy is a python library that allows users to perform information-theoretic
analyses on molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. It includes methods to
calculate:

- Bias-Corrected Entropy
- Conditional Entropy
- Mutual Information
- Normalized Mutual Information
- Conditional Mutual Information
- Normalized Conditional Mutual Information


MDEntropy is actively being developed by researchers at Stanford University, with primary
application areas in computational protein dynamics and drug design, and distributed
under the `MIT License <https://tldrlegal.com/l/mit>`_.
All development takes place on `GitHub <https://github.com/msmbuilder/mdentropy>`_.
